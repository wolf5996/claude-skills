# CODEX.md

This repository contains opinionated Codex skills for R and bioinformatics workflows. Each skill lives in its own directory with a single `SKILL.md` file and optional `agents/openai.yaml` metadata.

## Discovery

Codex discovers user skills from top-level directories in `~/.codex/skills/`. If this repository is kept in `~/.codex/skills/personal_skills/`, each skill should also have a symlink one level up so it can be discovered directly.

## Adding or Updating Skills

1. Add or update `<skill-name>/SKILL.md`
2. Regenerate `agents/openai.yaml` if the human-facing metadata changed
3. Ensure the top-level symlink exists in `~/.codex/skills/`
4. Keep naming lowercase and hyphen-separated
