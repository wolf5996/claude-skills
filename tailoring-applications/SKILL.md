# Tailoring Applications

Full pipeline skill for producing tailored CVs and cover letters from job adverts. Covers academic and industry applications. Self-contained — embeds all writing and formatting rules.

## Phase Detection

Before doing anything, detect which phase to enter based on what already exists. If the user provides a fresh advert, start at Phase 1. If an application directory already exists, pick up from the appropriate phase.

```
Phase 1: ANALYSE   → No directory exists, or no description.md / assessment.md
Phase 2: SCAFFOLD  → Directory exists with analysis files but missing QMDs
Phase 3: DRAFT     → QMDs need to be written or revised
Phase 4: RENDER    → QMDs are final, produce PDFs
```

Detection logic:

1. User provides an advert (text, URL, or PDF) → Phase 1
2. Directory exists with `description.md` + `assessment.md` but no QMDs → Phase 2
3. QMDs exist and user asks to revise → Phase 3
4. User explicitly asks to render → Phase 4

## Upfront Classification

Before Phase 1, determine the application type:

- **Academic** — university, research institute, or academic-adjacent position
- **Industry** — biotech, pharma, CRO, or commercial company

If obvious from the advert, infer and confirm. If ambiguous, ask. This classification drives tone, structure, and CV ordering throughout.

---

## Phase 1: ANALYSE

Parse the job advert and produce two files.

### Input Handling

The advert may arrive as:
- **Pasted text** — use directly
- **URL** — fetch with WebFetch and extract the job listing content
- **PDF file** — read with the Read tool

### Output: `description.md`

Structured breakdown of the advert. Follow this template:

```markdown
# [Institution/Company] — [Role Title]

## Role Summary

- **Title:** [Full title]
- **Employer:** [Organisation]
- **Location:** [City, remote/hybrid/on-site]
- **Salary:** [If stated, otherwise "Not disclosed"]
- **Type:** [Full-time/Part-time, Academic/Industry]
- **Focus:** [One-sentence summary of what the role does]
- **PI/Director:** [If academic, name the PI or group lead]

**Apply:**

- [Application method and link]

---

## About [Organisation/Department]

[2-3 paragraph summary of the organisation, department, or group. What they do, why it matters, scale.]

---

## Key Responsibilities

- [Bulleted list extracted or inferred from advert]

## Essential Requirements

- [Bulleted list — these are hard requirements]

## Desirable Requirements

- [Bulleted list — nice-to-haves]

---
```

Description formatting rules:

- Role-summary metadata must be a markdown bullet list using `- **Label:** value`.
- Do not emit bare bold metadata rows such as `**Title:** ...`.
- Leave `**Apply:**` as a standalone label followed by a blank line and a bullet list.
- Keep a blank line before every list start so pandoc renders lists vertically.

### Output: `assessment.md`

Honest, structured fit assessment. Follow this template:

```markdown
# [Institution/Company] — [Role Title]

- **Date applied:** [Today's date, YYYY-MM-DD]
- **Link:** [Application URL]
- **Location:** [City + remote/hybrid/on-site]
- **Salary:** [If known]
- **Company:** [One-sentence description of the organisation]
- **Role:** [One-sentence description of what the role involves]
- **Application method:** [How to apply]
- **Note:** [One-line honest assessment of fit — e.g., "Strong match on bioinformatics, weaker on ML engineering"]

---

## Overall Likelihood: ~[X]% ([Brief qualifier])

[2-3 sentence honest assessment of chances.]

---

## Top 3 Things Most Likely to Get You Shortlisted

1. **[Strength].** [Why this matters for this specific role.]
2. **[Strength].** [Why this matters.]
3. **[Strength].** [Why this matters.]

---

## Top 3 Things Most Likely to Sink the Application

1. **[Weakness].** [Why this is a problem for this specific role.]
2. **[Weakness].** [Why this is a problem.]
3. **[Weakness].** [Why this is a problem.]

---

## What You Could Do Before Applying

1. **[Action].** [How this would strengthen the application.]
2. **[Action].** [How this would help.]
3. **[Action].** [How this would help.]

---

## Is It Worth Applying?

**[Yes/No/Borderline].** [Reasoning — consider scale of hiring, stretch factor, learning value, network value.]
```

### Assessment Rules

- Be brutally honest about fit. Do not inflate likelihood.
- Assess against the applicant's actual profile (see Applicant Profile section below).
- 60-70% criteria match is sufficient to recommend applying.
- Flag when an application is a stretch but still worth it for learning or networking.

---

## Phase 2: SCAFFOLD

Create the application directory and file structure.

### Directory Naming

```
{academic,industry}_applications/YYYY-MM-DD_institution_shortname/
```

Examples:
- `academic_applications/2026-03-20_oxford_snelling/`
- `industry_applications/2026-03-20_healx_bioinformatician/`

Use today's date. Institution shortname should be lowercase, underscored, recognisable.

### Files to Create

```
YYYY-MM-DD_institution_shortname/
├── description.md                                          (from Phase 1)
├── assessment.md                                           (from Phase 1)
├── badran_elshenawy_<institution>_cover_letter.qmd         (empty scaffold)
└── badran_elshenawy_<institution>_cv.qmd                   (empty scaffold)
```

The QMD files should be scaffolded with the correct YAML front matter (see Formatting section) but no body content yet — that comes in Phase 3.

---

## Phase 3: DRAFT

Write the cover letter and CV content. This is the core of the skill.

### 3A: Cover Letter

The cover letter is **not a list of qualifications** — the CV handles that. The cover letter argues for **product-market fit**: why the institution needs someone like you, and why you are that person. The reader should finish thinking "this is an obvious hire," not "this person meets the criteria."

#### Structure: Product-Market Fit

```
\begin{flushright}
\textcolor{accent}{\textbf{Dr Badran Elshenawy}}\\
Nuffield Department of Medicine\\
University of Oxford\\
Oxford OX3 7FZ\\[0.6em]
[Date]
\end{flushright}

\textcolor{accent}{\textbf{[Supporting Statement / Application] --- [Role Title] (Ref: [number])}}\
[Institution / Department]

Dear [Hiring Committee / named contact],

## Where [Institution/Group] is heading
[1 paragraph: what the group/institute is doing, what direction they are moving in,
and what kind of person that direction calls for. Show you understand their context.
End with a line connecting yourself to that context.]

## What I bring
[1-2 paragraphs: your strongest relevant experience, framed as delivery not credentials.
Show what you have already done that maps to what they need. Let facts speak.
Be confident but not arrogant — "I have done X" not "I am the best at X".]

## [Research / Domain / Technical depth section — title varies by role]
[1-2 paragraphs: demonstrate that your research or technical work is directly
relevant to the role. Connect your daily work to their questions.
Show the overlap is real, not just theoretical.]

## Why [Institution] specifically
[1 paragraph: genuine, specific reasons. Timing, culture, partnerships, direction.
Not generic praise. Show you have done your homework.]

## What I am offering
[2-3 sentence summary. What you bring, what you want to do, openness to discuss.]

\vspace{0.6em}
Yours sincerely,
\vspace{0.2em}
\textcolor{accent}{\textbf{Dr Badran Elshenawy}}
```

**Rules:**
- **Product-market fit, not criterion checklist.** The CV lists qualifications; the cover letter argues for fit
- **Research the institution.** Use WebSearch to understand what they are building, what direction they are moving in, and what problems the hire is meant to solve. Reference specifics (papers, programmes, partnerships)
- Section headings should be narrative, not bureaucratic (e.g., "Where the lab is heading" not "Essential Criterion 1")
- Be direct but not arrogant. Confident but humble. "I have done X" not "I am the obvious choice"
- Avoid contrastive reframing and negation (e.g., "not just X, but Y"). State the positive directly
- Light use of em dashes only. Prefer commas, semicolons, or parentheses
- Use CAR framework where giving examples, but embed it in narrative, not as a checklist
- British English throughout
- No word padding — every sentence must earn its place
- If there is a gap in your profile, address it briefly (one sentence) and move on. Do not dwell on weaknesses

#### Supporting Statements (Oxford-style)

When the advert specifically asks for a "supporting statement that addresses each selection criterion," the product-market fit structure still works, but ensure each criterion is visibly addressed within the narrative sections. The reader should be able to tick off criteria while reading a compelling argument, not a bulleted list.

#### Industry Cover Letters

Same product-market fit approach, but:

- **Lead with what you deliver**, not your academic pedigree
- Emphasise transferable technical capabilities and outcomes
- Frame academic work in industry-relevant terms (e.g., "production-quality pipelines" not "research workflows")
- Shorter — industry reviewers scan faster

### 3B: CV Tailoring

Start from the master CV template at `cv_iterations/badran_elshenawy_cv_template.qmd`. Copy it into the application directory as `badran_elshenawy_<institution>_cv.qmd`, then tailor:

#### Elevator Pitch (Top Section)

Rewrite the elevator pitch using Past → Present → Future framework, tailored to this specific role. This is the most important section — reviewers scan in an F-pattern.

#### Section Ordering

- **Academic applications:** Area of study and science first. Research Experience before Technical Skills.
- **Industry applications:** Skills and methodology first. Technical Skills before Research Experience.

#### Bullet Point Tailoring

- **Relevant bullet points go to the top** of each section
- **Bold the verb** at the start of each bullet
- Use CAR framework: Accomplished X as measured by Y by doing Z
- All three CAR elements must be present (order is flexible)
- Focus on **your role first, the project second**
- Be specific — vague bullets do not demonstrate expertise
- Scan the advert for keywords and ensure they appear naturally in the CV

#### CV Constraints

- 2 pages maximum — strict
- 11pt font, narrow margins
- Reverse chronological within each section
- ORCID in contact header
- Must include: publications, open-source software, teaching, academic citizenship
- Do NOT remove sections wholesale — tailor within sections by reordering and rewording

### Writing Rules (Both Documents)

- **British English** spelling and conventions throughout
- **CAR framework** for all examples: Context, Action, Result
- **Nature Communications (2025):** Badran is a courtesy co-author — describe as "co-author" only. Do NOT claim he "contributed computational analyses."
- **PacBio pipeline:** He built it (real Snakemake work) but the team never used it. Fine to cite as evidence of engineering skills. Do NOT claim he "routinely integrates PacBio data."
- **Honesty over inflation.** If something is a stretch, frame it as a trajectory ("actively developing", "building towards") rather than claiming current mastery.
- **No word padding.** Every sentence must carry information. Cut filler.

---

## Phase 4: RENDER

Render both QMDs to PDF:

```bash
quarto render badran_elshenawy_<institution>_cover_letter.qmd --to pdf
quarto render badran_elshenawy_<institution>_cv.qmd --to pdf
```

After rendering, report:
- Word count for the cover letter (flag if over any stated limit)
- Page count for the CV (must be ≤ 2 pages)
- Any rendering errors

If the CV exceeds 2 pages, go back to Phase 3 and trim.

---

## Phase 5: OUTREACH

After rendering, draft a concise outreach email to the PI or hiring manager. Save as `outreach_<name>.md` in the application directory.

### Finding the contact

Use WebSearch to find the PI's email address. Check institutional staff pages, lab websites, and departmental directories. UCL emails typically follow `f.lastname@ucl.ac.uk`, Oxford follows `firstname.lastname@department.ox.ac.uk`.

### Outreach email structure

```markdown
# Outreach — [Name]

**To:** [email]
**Subject:** Application for [Role Title] (Ref [number])

---

[Greeting]

[1 sentence: you applied, linking to the role]

[1 paragraph: genuine interest in their specific work. Reference a paper, tool,
programme, or direction. Show you have read something real, not just the advert.]

[1 paragraph: specific value proposition. What you bring that connects to what
they are building. Be concrete — name datasets, methods, or experience that
maps directly to their needs.]

[1 sentence: ask for a meeting, offer flexibility]

Best,
Badran
```

### Rules

- Short. 4-5 paragraphs maximum.
- Genuine interest, not flattery.
- The value proposition paragraph should be specific and separate from the interest paragraph.
- Light on em dashes. No contrastive negation ("not just X, but Y").
- Tone: direct, warm, professional. Not formal, not casual.
