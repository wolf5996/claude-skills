# Claude Code Skills for R & Bioinformatics

Opinionated [Claude Code] skills for single-cell RNA-seq analysis, R package development, and scientific documentation. Built for bioinformatics workflows using Seurat, Bioconductor, tidyverse, and Quarto.

  [Claude Code]: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code

These skills encode specific conventions, patterns, and quality standards that Claude Code follows when working on your projects. They are deliberately opinionated — fork and adapt them to your own workflow.

## What Are Claude Code Skills?

Skills are markdown files (`SKILL.md`) that teach Claude Code domain-specific conventions. When Claude detects a relevant task (e.g., editing a `.qmd` file), it loads the matching skill and follows its rules. Skills live in `~/.claude/skills/` as subdirectories, each containing a single `SKILL.md` file.

## Skills Overview

| Skill | Domain | Description |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|
| **creating-analysis-projects** | Project Setup | Scaffolds bioinformatics analysis projects with strict separation of code (git-tracked) from data. Enforces the `read/` → `scripts/` → `checkpoints/` → `write/` directory architecture. |
| **writing-r-code** | R Coding | Tidyverse-first R coding conventions. Self-contained code chunks with `Libraries → Inputs → Processing → Outputs` structure. Seurat v5 layer-based patterns. Mandatory Context7 MCP verification for function calls. |
| **writing-qmd-scientific** | Quarto Documents | Standards for scientific Quarto notebooks. All explanatory prose must be bullet points (no paragraphs). Hashpipe (`#\|`) chunk options. Parameter justification tables after every code block. |
| **writing-labarchive-entries** | Lab Notebooks | Verbose, structured lab documentation with numbered sections. Four entry types: Reference Datasets, Analysis Pipelines, Tool Evaluations, Educational Notes. PubMed MCP integration for citations. |
| **developing-r-packages** | R Packages | Full R package lifecycle following Wickham & Bryan's *R Packages*. roxygen2 documentation, testthat testing, semantic versioning, GitHub Actions CI/CD, pkgdown sites. |
| **tailoring-applications** | Job Applications | Full pipeline for tailoring CVs and cover letters from job adverts. Parses job postings (text, URL, or PDF), scaffolds application directories, and produces tailored application documents for academic and industry roles. |
| **md-to-html** | Document Conversion | Converts markdown files into self-contained HTML documents via Quarto. Wraps `.md` content in a `.qmd` with a preferred YAML header (darkly theme, TOC, embedded resources) and renders with `quarto render`. Preserves content as-is—conversion only, no restructuring. |

## Skill Dependencies

The skills reference and build on each other:

```         
creating-analysis-projects
├── writing-r-code          (code chunk conventions)
└── writing-qmd-scientific  (document structure)
    └── writing-r-code      (inline code patterns)

writing-labarchive-entries   (standalone — references PubMed MCP)
developing-r-packages       (standalone — R package conventions)
tailoring-applications      (standalone — CV and cover letter pipeline)
md-to-html                  (standalone — converts .md → .qmd → .html via Quarto)
```

**Reading order for newcomers:**

1. `creating-analysis-projects` — the overall project architecture
2. `writing-r-code` — code patterns used everywhere
3. `writing-qmd-scientific` — how to document analysis pipelines
4. `developing-r-packages` and `writing-labarchive-entries` — advanced/specialized
5. `tailoring-applications` — CV and cover letter pipeline
6. `md-to-html` — converting finished markdown to polished HTML

## Prerequisites

### Required

-   [Claude Code] CLI installed

  [Claude Code]: https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code

### BadranSeq

These skills reference [**BadranSeq**] as the preferred visualization package for scRNA-seq figures. I built BadranSeq to wrap Seurat, ggplot2, and ComplexHeatmap into a single package that produces publication-ready single-cell figures with minimal boilerplate.

  [**BadranSeq**]: https://github.com/wolf5996/BadranSeq

-   **GitHub:** [wolf5996/BadranSeq]
-   **Package site:** [wolf5996.github.io/BadranSeq]
-   **Used in:** `writing-r-code` (as the primary visualization fallback chain: BadranSeq → SCpubr → Seurat)

  [wolf5996/BadranSeq]: https://github.com/wolf5996/BadranSeq
  [wolf5996.github.io/BadranSeq]: https://wolf5996.github.io/BadranSeq/

If you don't use BadranSeq, see the [Fork & Customize] section below for how to swap in your own preferred visualization package.

### Recommended MCP Servers

-   [**Context7**] — `writing-r-code` mandates Context7 lookups to verify function signatures for 17+ R/Bioconductor packages before writing code. Without it, Claude will still write R code but won't verify against live documentation.
-   **PubMed MCP** — `writing-labarchive-entries` uses PubMed for citation lookups. Optional but enhances documentation quality.

## Installation

**Clone into your Claude Code skills directory:**

``` bash
# Back up any existing skills first
cp -r ~/.claude/skills ~/.claude/skills.bak

# Clone this repo as your skills directory
git clone https://github.com/wolf5996/claude-skills.git ~/.claude/skills
```

**Or cherry-pick individual skills:**

``` bash
# Clone somewhere temporary
git clone https://github.com/wolf5996/claude-skills.git /tmp/claude-skills

# Copy just the skills you want
cp -r /tmp/claude-skills/writing-r-code ~/.claude/skills/
cp -r /tmp/claude-skills/writing-qmd-scientific ~/.claude/skills/

# Clean up
rm -rf /tmp/claude-skills
```

## Fork & Customize

These skills are personal and opinionated by design. To make them yours:

1.  **Fork this repository** on GitHub
2.  **Swap author name** — search for `Badran Elshenawy` in YAML templates and replace with your name
3.  **Swap preferred packages** — `writing-r-code` references `BadranSeq` as the primary visualization package; replace with your own (e.g., `SCpubr`, `dittoSeq`, or base `Seurat`)
4.  **Adjust project paths** — `creating-analysis-projects` uses a specific `read/scripts/checkpoints/write/` layout; adapt if your lab uses different conventions
5.  **Adjust Context7 package list** — `writing-r-code` lists 17+ packages for mandatory lookup; add or remove packages to match your stack

## Design Decisions

A few things that look like inconsistencies are actually intentional:

-   **Numbered vs unnumbered headings**: `writing-qmd-scientific` forbids numbered headings (Quarto's TOC handles navigation), while `writing-labarchive-entries` mandates numbered sections (standalone records need explicit structure). Different document types, different conventions.
-   **Bullet points only in QMD**: `writing-qmd-scientific` strictly forbids paragraph prose outside code chunks — everything must be bullet points with nested sub-bullets. This is a deliberate readability choice, not a general rule for all skills.
-   **Self-contained chunks**: Every code chunk loads its own data from a checkpoint file rather than depending on in-memory state from previous chunks. This makes chunks independently runnable and debuggable.

## Adding New Skills

This repository is a work in progress. New skills are added as workflows mature.

**To add a skill:**

1.  Create a new directory: `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`

2.  Add a `SKILL.md` file with YAML frontmatter:

    ``` yaml
    ---
    name: skill-name
    description: When to trigger this skill. Be specific about file types, task types, and contexts.
    ---
    ```

3.  Write the skill content following the patterns in existing skills

4.  Update this README's skills table and dependency graph

5.  Commit and push

**Naming convention:** lowercase, hyphen-separated (e.g., `writing-r-code`, `creating-analysis-projects`)
